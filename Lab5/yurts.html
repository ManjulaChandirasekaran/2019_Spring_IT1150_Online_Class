<dl>
  <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
     <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
  <dt><strong>How are yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
     <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury campling experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
  <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
     <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
